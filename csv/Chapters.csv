0,Background - Raleigh,media/visit_raleigh.jpg,Source: Raleigh Government,https://raleighnc.gov/,"In the 1950’s, a little bit after World War II ended the     Housing Act of 1954 saw the concept of urban renewal begin to really take hold over the urban centers of America.     The goal was to revitalize the aging and decaying parts of inner cities, build new public housing, and create a network     of highways to connect these restored cities across the Nation. However, this revitalization was affected by racist ideology     of the time. In the name of urban renewal, it was most often the African American residents or business owners that were     forcibly pushed out from their homes or businesses for redevelopment. Specific to Raleigh, the segregation of communities     was further enforced when exclusively white suburbs were expanded to the North and West of the city, and Black housing     developments were developed towards the Southeast. Notably, these housing developments include Rochester Heights and     Biltmore Hills. The difference of location between these two pockets of development is key to understanding the origin of     environmental justice issues currently affecting Southeast Raleigh. The white neighborhoods were built on higher elevation     land, meaning those communities faced less frequent and intense flooding events. The Black neighborhoods were built on     lower elevation land, meaning those communities faced more frequent and intense flooding events.",15.75,Plain,Red,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
1,Background - Flooding,media/flooding.png,,,"Due to the large amount of infrastructure and non-porous surfaces     that surround the area, Southeast Raleigh sees a lot of flooding. Raleigh is an extremely developed city,      and so during rain events the almost constant concrete and asphalt do not offer any way for rain to     infiltrate into the ground. This will cause the water to runoff, flowing down to lower elevations. The water     may also pool in areas of lower elevation that are close to human activity, which at best can be inconvenient     and at worst can be a public health issue. Flood waters should always be approached with caution, as there is     never any way of telling what they may contain. Since flood waters often move across land before settling in a     final location, there is ample opportunity for things such as pollution, human waste, and livestock waste to be     picked up and moved along with it. Interaction with flood waters that have picked up waste of any kind can lead     to gastrointestinal illnesses. Currently, nuisance flooding has been cited by Southeast Raleigh residents as a     top frustration. This indicates that while the issue is not extreme, frequent inundation of low-lying areas is     still affecting their quality of life enough to be seen as a clear issue.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
2,Background - WQ Parameters,media/ysi.jpg,,,"There are four key parameters that are used     to help determine the quality of a water sample or source: dissolved oxygen (DO),     pH, specific conductivity (SPC), and E.coli. Since the focus of this study is on     human health, the water quality parameters of E.coli and SPC will be most closely     studied. E.coli is one specific enteric pathogen that is tested for in water, as     it is an indicator of the presence of fecal matter. In this study, it is most     important to the health of human life, where interaction with contaminated water     can lead to gastrointestinal illness. SPC refers to how well a water sample can     carry an electrical current, and is a direct measure of the amount of ions found     in a water source. In this study, tt is most important to the health of human life,     where more ions may be indicative of more debris/sediment/pollution found in the water source.",15.75,Plain,Blue,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
3,Objective,,,,"The objective of this study is to better     understand the connection between flooding, water quality, and environmental     justice in Southeast Raleigh",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
4,Result - E.coli and Discharge,media/ecoli_correlation.jpg,,,"The results of the Pearson correlation     between E.coli and discharge showed a positive correlation, indicating that the     two variables have a direct relationship. When one variable increases, the other     will also increase, and vice versa. This correlation appears to be moderate, as     the absolute value of 0.4 falls within the 0.3 and 0.49 range. From this, it may     be concluded that changes in E.coli are moderately influenced by changes in discharge.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
5,Result - SPC and Discharge,media/SPC_correlation.jpg,,,"The results of the Pearson correlation     between SPC and discharge showed a negative correlation, indicating that the     two variables have an inverse relationship. This correlation appears to be     strong, as the absolute value of 0.67 falls within the 0.5 - 1 range. From this,     it may be concluded that changes in SPC are heavily influenced by changes in     discharge, but in the sense that if discharge increases, SPC will increase.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
6,Result - Percentage of Minority Persons,media/minority_demographics.jpg,,,"The Southeast portion of the     subwatershed sees census tracts with around 70% - 90% of minority persons,     while the Northwest portion of the subwatershed sees census tracts with around 30% - 50%.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
7,Result- Percent of Tract That Intersect an Impaired watershed,media/impaired_percentage.jpg,,,"The whole Wake County area, Raleigh     itself sees census tracts that intersect an impaired/impacted watershed with     the highest percentages of around 50%. As you move south down the subwatershed     away from central Raleigh, percentages of census tracts that intersect an     impaired/impacted watershed decrease.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
8,Result - Percentage Below 200% Poverty,media/poverty_percentage.jpg,,,"Some census tracts in the     Northern portion of the subwatershed, those closer to central Raleigh,     see higher poverty percentages. Otherwise, the rest of the subwatershed     sees census tracts that sit between 20% - 50%.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
9,"Result - Percentage of Households That Make Less than $75,000",media/lessthan75000_percentage.jpg,,,"Some census tracts in the Northern     portion of the subwatershed, those closer to central Raleigh, see higher     percentages of households that make under $75,000. Otherwise, the rest of     the subwatershed sees census tracts that sit between 10% and 40%.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
10,Result - Percentage of Unemployed Persons,media/unemployed_percentage.jpg,,,"A pocket of census tracts around     the middle of the subwatershed have the highest percentages of persons     who are unemployed around 15%. Furthermore, as you move Southeast across     the subwatershed, it can be seen that percentages of persons who are     unemployed increase.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
11,Result - Subwatershed Elevation,media/walnut_creek_elevation.jpg,,,The Northeast portion of the     subwatershed possesses the highest elevation of the subwatershed.    It can then be seen that elevation decreases as you move Southeast     down the subwatershed.,15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
12,Result - Subwatershed Land Use,media/walnut_creek_ncld.jpg,,,"The North and central portion     of the subwatershed is very developed, mainly featuring land use     classes of “developed, open space,” “developed, low intensity,”     “developed, medium intensity,” and “developed, high intensity.”",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
13,Discussion,,,,"E.coli was the only parameter to be     positively correlated to flooding. The correlation was moderate, indicating     that an increase in nuisance flooding may moderately influence an increase in     E.coli bacteria. This suggests that there will be the chance for increased     public health consequences in the form of gastrointestinal illness for the     residents of Southeast Raleigh during nuisance flooding events. Runoff has to     follow decreasing elevation and flow across majorly developed areas before     finally reaching Southeast Raleigh. This allows for a larger opportunity for     water to pick up bacteria from waste before coming to rest at the lower     elevations of Southeast Raleigh. Due to the geographic location of higher     minority populations correlating with areas of lower elevation, there is     still an environmental justice issue with these populations facing higher     rates of nuisance flooding and consequently higher rates of possible E.coli     contamination.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
14,Limitations,,,,"The original USGS monitoring station     that I had chosen, which was closer to the sampling site, had actually not been     collecting data for some time. A new USGS monitoring  station that was much farther     North and found more within central Raleigh had to be used. As a result, the discharge     data gained from the new USGS monitoring station may not exactly align with the     discharge actually seen at the water quality sampling site.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
