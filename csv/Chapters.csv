0,Background - Raleigh,media/visit_raleigh.jpg,Source: Raleigh Government,https://raleighnc.gov/,"In the 1950â€™s, a little bit after World War II ended the     Housing Act of 1954 saw the concept of urban renewal begin to really take hold over the urban centers of America.     The goal was to revitalize the aging and decaying parts of inner cities, build new public housing, and create a network     of highways to connect these restored cities across the Nation. However, this revitalization was affected by racist ideology     of the time. In the name of urban renewal, it was most often the African American residents or business owners that were     forcibly pushed out from their homes or businesses for redevelopment. Specific to Raleigh, the segregation of communities     was further enforced when exclusively white suburbs were expanded to the North and West of the city, and Black housing     developments were developed towards the Southeast. Notably, these housing developments include Rochester Heights and     Biltmore Hills. The difference of location between these two pockets of development is key to understanding the origin of     environmental justice issues currently affecting Southeast Raleigh. The white neighborhoods were built on higher elevation     land, meaning those communities faced less frequent and intense flooding events. The Black neighborhoods were built on     lower elevation land, meaning those communities faced more frequent and intense flooding events.",15.75,Plain,Red,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
1,Background - Flooding,media/flooding.png,,,"Due to the large amount of infrastructure and non-porous surfaces     that surround the area, Southeast Raleigh sees a lot of flooding. Raleigh is an extremely developed city,      and so during rain events the almost constant concrete and asphalt do not offer any way for rain to     infiltrate into the ground. This will cause the water to runoff, flowing down to lower elevations. The water     may also pool in areas of lower elevation that are close to human activity, which at best can be inconvenient     and at worst can be a public health issue. Flood waters should always be approached with caution, as there is     never any way of telling what they may contain. Since flood waters often move across land before settling in a     final location, there is ample opportunity for things such as pollution, human waste, and livestock waste to be     picked up and moved along with it. Interaction with flood waters that have picked up waste of any kind can lead     to gastrointestinal illnesses. Currently, nuisance flooding has been cited by Southeast Raleigh residents as a     top frustration. This indicates that while the issue is not extreme, frequent inundation of low-lying areas is     still affecting their quality of life enough to be seen as a clear issue.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
2,Background - WQ Parameters,media/ysi.jpg,,,"There are four key parameters that are used     to help determine the quality of a water sample or source: dissolved oxygen (DO),     pH, specific conductivity (SPC), and E.coli. Since the focus of this study is on     human health, the water quality parameters of E.coli and SPC will be most closely     studied. E.coli is one specific enteric pathogen that is tested for in water, as     it is an indicator of the presence of fecal matter. In this study, it is most     important to the health of human life, where interaction with contaminated water     can lead to gastrointestinal illness. SPC refers to how well a water sample can     carry an electrical current, and is a direct measure of the amount of ions found     in a water source. In this study, tt is most important to the health of human life,     where more ions may be indicative of more debris/sediment/pollution found in the water source.",15.75,Plain,Blue,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
3,Objective,,,,"The objective of this study is to better     understand the connection between flooding, water quality, and environmental     justice in Southeast Raleigh",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
4,Result - E.coli and Discharge,media/ecoli_correlation.jpg,,,"The results of the Pearson correlation     between E.coli and discharge showed a positive correlation, indicating that the     two variables have a direct relationship. When one variable increases, the other     will also increase, and vice versa. This correlation appears to be moderate, as     the absolute value of 0.4 falls within the 0.3 and 0.49 range. From this, it may     be concluded that changes in E.coli are moderately influenced by changes in discharge.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.759142,-78.624447,,,,
